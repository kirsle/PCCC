<h1>Chat Console</h1>

The <b>Chat Console</b> (also known as the Debug Window) is a small window that
 monitors all incoming and outgoing TCP packets. It's useful as a debugging tool,
 and to see what's really going on in the background during your CC connection.<p>

Messages sent from your client to the server appear in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>
 text, while messages received from the server are in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>.<p>

Note that the chat console <b>does not</b> automatically scroll so long as you have
 the window opened. This is actually more useful for debugging purposes than having
 the window keep scrolling to the bottom constantly. However, when you first open the
 window, it will automatically jump to the bottom.<p>

To make the window disappear, click the "Dismiss" button. The "X" button on the title
 bar won't close the window.
