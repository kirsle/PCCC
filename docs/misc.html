<h1>Preferences: Miscellaneous</h1>

<h2>External Programs</h2>

<blockquote>
	<b>Web Browser Command</b>
	<blockquote>
		This is the command-line program used for launching your web
		browser. The dropdown list includes the most likely programs
		for each operating system, but you can type in a custom command
		too (ex: "firefox")<p>

		Windows users should be fine with <b>start</b><br>
		Linux and Unix users should use <b>htmlview</b><br>
		Mac OS users should use <b>open</b>
	</blockquote>

	<b>Command-line Media Player</b>
	<blockquote>
		This is the command-line program used for playing sound effects.
		This is only applicable to Linux and Mac users. On Windows, the
		module Win32::MediaPlayer is used instead.<p>

		Linux users should be fine with <b>play</b>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Miscellaneous Options</h2>

<blockquote>
	<b>Show private messages in new windows</b>
	<blockquote>
		When checked, all private messages will appear in their own "IM"
		windows. Disable this to get the standard CC behavior back. When
		disabled, IM windows can only be created by double-clicking a user's
		name in the list.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Ignore private messages from ChatServer</b>
	<blockquote>
		Check this to ignore all private messages from ChatServer. This
		is <b>NOT RECOMMENDED</b>. It's most useful on the test server,
		where ChatServer echoes a confirmation of every little thing your
		client does, but should not be used on the real server.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Show *...* messages as /me actions</b>
	<blockquote>
		This option will automatically display messages as "/me" actions
		if they start and end with asterisks. See
		<a href="action.html">Action Messages</a>.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Highlight typo corrections</b>
	<blockquote>
		This option will automatically display "typo" messages uniquely.
		See <a href="action.html">Action Messages</a>.
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Revert to Default Settings</h2>

This button will restore all of your configuration back to the defaults.
