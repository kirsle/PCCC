<h1>Action Messages</h1>

"Action Messages" are a bit of an extension to the CyanChat protocol. It's not
 actually supported on the CC server, but several home-made CC clients support
 this.

<h2>IRC-Style /me Actions</h2>

Typing in "/me &lt;action&gt;" in the message space is the standard way of sending
 an action message. To all clients who support the feature, your message should appear
 special on their client. To those which don't support the feature, they'll simply
 see "/me &lt;action&gt;" from you.

<h2>Automatic Actions</h2>

There is an option on the <a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous</a> tab of the Preferences
 window which will automatically display certain messages in the "action" format.<p>

When enabled, a message that begins and ends with asterisks (*) will automatically be
 displayed as action messages.

<h2>Typo Messages</h2>

Typo messages are similar to action messages in that they display in a special color.
 When a message is received that begins with a * but doesn't end with one, the message
 is displayed normally, but the text is displayed in the "action color"
