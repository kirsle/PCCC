<h1>Send Raw Command</h1>

<font size="5" color="red"><b>WARNING!!!</b></font><p>

This function of PCCC is <b>VERY</b> dangerous. The CyanChat server is very picky
 about the messages it will receive from your client. If you send an improperly
 formatted command, you may be banned from the server.<p>

I cannot be held responsible if you get yourself banned by using this feature.

<h2>Sending a Raw Command</h2>

To send a raw command, type it into the text box on the "Send Raw Command" window.
 Press "Send Command" to send it. The "Return" key <b>will not</b> send the command
 (as of version 3.0), because accidentally tapping Return and sending an incomplete
 command was an easy way to get banned.<p>

Press the "Spawn Debug Window" button to open the <a href="console.html">Chat
 Console</a> window.
