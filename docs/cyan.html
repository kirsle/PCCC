<h1>Cyan Staff</h1>

The Cyan Staff (also known as Cyanites or Cyantists) are the staff members of the
 company Cyan Worlds. When they enter the chat room, their "link in" message will
 read: "&lt;links in from Cyan Worlds, Inc.&gt;"<p>

Additionally, their nicknames will be placed in the "Cyan &amp; Guests" list instead
 of the standard Who List, and their names will appear in
 <font color="#00FFFF" back="#000000">cyan</font> text.

<h1>Special Guests</h1>

Occasionally, a Cyantist will promote a regular user to the level of "Special Guest".
 Special Guests also appear in the special "Cyan &amp; Guests" list, and their nicknames
 will appear in <font color="#FF9900" back="#000000">orange</font> text.
