<h1>CyanChat Rules</h1>

* Be respectful of and sensitive to others.<br>
* Please, no platform wars ("my computer is better than yours").<br>
* Keep it "G" rated; in other words, suitable for family viewing.<br>
* No flooding, in other words, filling the screen with junk.<br>
* But most of all HAVE FUN!

<h2>Impersonating</h2>

No name or handle is reserved for any one person. However, purposely impersonating
 someone for personal gain or in disrespect of the person being impersonated
 will not be tolerated. So, please try to find a unique name for yourself.

<h2>Being Banned</h2>

The CyanChat server has a bad language filter that watches all the messages being
 sent. If it detects that you have used bad language, depending how severe,
 it might automatically ban you from using CyanChat, ban you for a day
 or just censor the message. Once you have been banned you will get a message
 when you start CyanChat that your IP address has been blocked from using CyanChat.

<h2>Getting Unbanned</h2>

There are many reasons why an IP address might be banned from CyanChat, some reasons
 are accidental, such as misspelling a word. If you've gotten accidentally banned,
 e-mail <a href="mailto:markd@cyan.com" target="_blank">markd@cyan.com</a> with the
 IP address that is banned. But one thing to remember is that MarkD has a log of all
 the bannings (and what was said) and it's usually quite obvious, so don't try the
 "accident" angle unless it really was.<p>
