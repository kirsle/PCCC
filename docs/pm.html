<h1>Private Messaging</h1>

The CyanChat server supports the sending of <b>private messages</b> to other
 participants of the chat room. There are three different ways to send private
 messages:

<h2>The CyanChat Way</h2>

The "CyanChat Way" is the method used in the standard CyanChat client. To send
 a private message to somebody:<p>

1. Select the recipient's name from the Who List<br>
2. Type in a message to send to them.<br>
3. Press the "Send Private" button located beneath the Who List.

<h2>The IRC Way</h2>

The "IRC Way" is the method that is used on IRC chat servers (CC is not based on
 IRC, but IRC users might be more familiar with this method).<p>

1. Type in "/msg &lt;recipeint&gt; &lt;message&gt;" into the message space.<br>
Example: /msg Cuvou hello there!<p>

The aliases <b>/whisper</b> and <b>/w</b> may also be used.

<h2>The IM Way</h2>

The final method, the "IM Way", is the method that is characteristic of Instant
 Messaging programs. Simply double-click a user's name from the Who List and open
 an Instant Message window with them.

<h1>Message Windows</h1>

Unless you disable it, the sending or receiving of private messages will always
 open a message window with that user. All later private messages received from
 the same user will go to this same window.<p>

If you have disabled this, then the only way to open a message window is if you
 open it yourself, by double-clicking a user's name. See
 <a href="misc.html">Miscellaneous Configuration Options</a>.
