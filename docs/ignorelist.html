<h1>Preferences: Ignored Users</h1>

<h2>Ignored Users</h2>

<blockquote>
	<b>Online Users</b>
	<blockquote>
		This listbox displays all of the users currently signed in to CyanChat
		(but not the ones you've ignored). Select a user from the list and press
		"Ignore Selected" to move them to the Ignored Users list.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Ignored Users</b>
	<blockquote>
		This listbox displays all of the users you've ignored. Select a user from
		the list and choose "Unignore Selected" to stop ignoring them.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Refresh Lists</b>
	<blockquote>
		This button will refresh the listboxes. The lists are also refreshed
		each time you bring focus to the "Ignored Users" tab.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Remember my ignore list</b>
	<blockquote>
		When checked, your ignore list will be saved when you exit PCCC and
		be reloaded when you start it again.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Perform mutual ignores</b>
	<blockquote>
		When checked, PCCC will automatically ignore any users who ignore us.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Tell me when somebody ignores me</b>
	<blockquote>
		When checked, you will receive a notification in the dialog window
		when somebody has ignored you.
	</blockquote>

	<b>Send server ignore command when ignoring users</b>
	<blockquote>
		When checked, ignoring a user will send a standard CC ignore command
		to the server. What this does is tells the server to relay your
		ignore to the client in question, so that they may perform a mutual
		ignore.
